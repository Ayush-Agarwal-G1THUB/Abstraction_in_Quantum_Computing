    "To show that using predicates on input and output states of different independent modules in quantum circuits to verify correctness is useful, here is a series of versions of Grover's algorithm with different bugs in different modules, to show it is possible to violate these predicates and still have a program that compiles. These versions will compile, but the logic underlying is wrong. This is possible when a programmer writes a module. It would be difficult to tell where such an error has occurred since it is a logical error, not a syntactical error."
